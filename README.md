Virtual Environment used: raghaystackfastapi

To activate the virtual environment:
conda activate "/Users/atharva7/Downloads/Complete RAG App using Haystack and FastAPI/raghaystackfastapi"

we have created a folder named "QASystem" in our project folder and the "-e ." command in requirements.txt will allow us to load the 
folder/package in our local environment.

if __init__ file is present, it is a local package inside of our system.

In the backend, the -e . runs the setup.py file.
